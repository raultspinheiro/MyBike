# MyBike

### Idea
This project was created while I was trying to learn selenium, and since I like motorcycles, more precisely Yamaha ones, it inspired me to do this CLI.

### How it works?
Yamaha puts on their website bike models that will just be released a few moths later. Since that models are not available yet, they show an alert message that informs the user about that. The objective of this CLI is to show the user if the model its available or not, and if it is, the program will show the price too.

### Warning!
This is just a "learning project" and it may not work in the future. It was my first selenium project
